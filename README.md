## Introduction

Regression analysis is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is widely used in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and marketing, for predicting numerical outcomes.

## Setup

The tutorial utilizes Jupyter Notebook, Python, and popular libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. Make sure to have these dependencies installed before running the code.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset used in this tutorial contains information about cars, including their brands, models, fuel types, and prices. Data preprocessing involves handling categorical variables using one-hot encoding and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Regression Models

We explore four regression models in this tutorial:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)

For each model, we create a pipeline that includes data preprocessing and model training.

## Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance of each regression model, we use the following metrics:
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R-squared (Coefficient of Determination)
- Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)

These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and predictive power of the models.

## Model Comparison

After evaluating the performance of each model, we compare their results and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. This comparison helps in selecting the most suitable model for the given problem.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to regression modeling, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and comparison. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you'll gain a better understanding of regression analysis and its practical application to real-world problems.
